Title: React UI Challenge
Objective
The objective of this task is to assess your understanding of ReactTS concepts and your
ability to design and implement user interfaces (UI) using ReactTS components. In this
challenge, you will be creating your own UI component from scratch, demonstrating your
knowledge of React best practices, component structure, and reusability.
This is the official first task of the curriculum, based on React Lesson 2, focusing mainly on
design implementation, styling and screen responsiveness.

Instructions:
● Using ReactTS, create a front-end implementation of the UI design.
● Pay close attention to the layout, colours, typography, and overall visual elements
to ensure accurate replication.
● You may use your own icons, images, and typography that closely resemble those
used in the UI design.
● Use appropriate ReactTS components and styling techniques to achieve the
desired design.
● Implement interactivity and responsiveness (from mobile to desktop) where
applicable.
● Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure proper functionality.
● Bonus: host your work using Github pages or firebase as you have learnt during the
bootcamp.
● Make sure all reappearing code is set up as reusable components to ensure
readability and maintainability
Notes:
● While replicating the design, focus on visual fidelity and user experience.
● Use your creativity to find icons, images, typography and colors (color codes) that
closely resemble those used in the UI design.
● Apply your knowledge of ReactTS and front-end development best practices to
accomplish the task.
● Make use of reusable components wherever possible.
● Feel free to use any additional tools that you are comfortable with.
● Be attentive to details and strive for accuracy in your implementation.
● Remember, the purpose of this task is to assess your ability to translate a design
into a functional UI using ReactTS. If you have any questions or need clarification,
please don't hesitate to reach out.
● Stick to plain CSS for styling
